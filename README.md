# WPR
This is my WPR assignment to create my full repository path.

Im a second year student in Belgium Campus iTversity, studying Diploma in Information Technology. I am passionate about what im studying because i love what i do on a daily basis. Not only i love what i do but i also have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In highschool this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills so that when im finally in Univerity, working or just done with highschool i can be able to face any challenge. Im a people person and even at school i love interacting and talking with other students. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and i like making people feel comfortable in my presence.
